  aboutMe:
    "I’m a full-stack web developer who enjoys taking ideas from concept to completion and being hands-on throughout the entire process. I’ve been programming since high school and found my passion for web development in college, which I’ve continued through freelance work. I primarily work with React or Next.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, and I take a lot of pride in the solo projects I’ve built from the ground up. I’m a calm, detail-oriented problem solver with a natural builder’s mindset, but I’m also easygoing, social, and genuinely enjoy sharing ideas and collaborating with others. Whether I’m working independently or as part of a team, I bring a steady approach, positive energy, and real enthusiasm for turning ideas into polished, user-facing products.",
